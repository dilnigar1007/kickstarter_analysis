# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This is a project about media, game, web, and food sectors which measures the success and fail rate for each subcategories such as Theater, Tabletop games, rock, and hardware. 

## Purpose
Purpose of this project is to see how many of the "theater" became successful, failed, and canceled in each month. Also to see the percentage of "plays" in total for different goal ranges, getting the trend line of successful cases comparing to the goal. 

## Analysis and Challenges
As we can see from the trend line ![Outcomes Based on Launch Date](/Users/dilinigeerduolikun/Desktop/DataClass/Dilly-s-challenges/kickstarter_analysis/Resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png), we have decreasing number of successful cases for the goals of 25,000 or more. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
In this project, the only and the biggest challenge was the pivot table. As I have limited experience with it, I was spending more time of selecting the columns, values, and fields. Also, I had "blank" column and row which I had to google in order to move it from my table. All I needed for it was to unselect "blank" from the filter.


## Results
### Conclusions on Outcomes based on Launch Date
Based on the graph we created for Outcomes based on Launch Date, we can say that most of the projects under theater became successful up until May, which is the peak of the year. It's having downward slope after hitting the peak. Very small part of the theater projects got cancelled throughout the years, it's very close to 0 in the graph. Also failed projects are somehwere in between these two categories, but very consistent every month.
### Conclusions on Outcomes based on Goals
Based on the goals, we have higher number of projects falling under small amount of goals under $25,000; the opposite, small number of projects for $25,000 or more goal brackets. And 0 projects under "canceled" which is good to see. 
### Recommendations
For these two, we could also use grouped bar graphs. For example, for the first one (by launch date), we can group by month and three different categories (three different bars with different colors) with 12 of them; for the second one, we can do the same thing and adding a line trend to it.
